## Roadmap
first watch this playlist to understand what neural networks is

building a neural net from scratch:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=12s

**topics need to learn:**
[[gradient]]
[[loss function]]
[[weight]]
[[bias]]
[[activation function]]
[[sigmoid function]]
[[perceptron]]
[[activation function]]
[[backpropagation]]

after this:
[[andrej kaparthy]]

then:
[[transformer model]]

## Learnings
visual learning representation [[learning map.canvas|learning map]]
The building block of any neural network is [[perceptron]]. a perceptron is the most basic and simplest type of artificial neuron. a perceptron has input neurons. these input neurons are multiplied by their corresponding [[weight]]. all the summation of inputs multiplied by their weight is added with a [[bias]]. This summation is then passed through an [[activation function]] function. The activation function squashes the output of that summation to a certain range so that we can decide what to do with that result.

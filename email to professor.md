Subject: Bachelor Thesis Direction and Upcoming Presentation

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I am writing to you today to discuss the direction of my bachelor thesis and to provide an update on my progress.

As you know, my approved topic focuses on the robustness of event-based action recognition models. I have completed the initial phase of this research, which involved training a 3D-CNN on the DVS128 Gesture dataset and establishing a strong baseline performance.

However, while working on this, I found my attention drawn to a related but distinct area: real-time 3D reconstruction for robot navigation. I became deeply interested in the challenges of creating lightweight, efficient environmental models for autonomous systems. This led me to explore 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and I have spent considerable time developing a new research proposal centered on this topic.

To be transparent, my enthusiasm for the original event-based project has waned, while I have become very passionate about the potential of this new direction. My proposed new thesis is titled, "Real-time Minimal-Geometry 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video using Pruned 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robot Navigation." The core idea is to create a system that reconstructs only essential geometry, making it practical for resource-constrained robots. I have already completed a thorough literature review, a detailed project plan, and a formal proposal for this new topic.

I have completed the initial experimental stage for both topics to ensure I was making a well-informed decision. For our presentation tomorrow, I have scripts and slides prepared and would be ready to present on this new 3DGS-based topic if you believe it is a worthwhile direction.

I would be very grateful for the opportunity to pursue this new research idea, as I feel a much stronger personal and academic motivation for it. However, I also want to respect your guidance. If you feel that this new idea is not sufficiently robust for a bachelor thesis, I am fully prepared to continue with the original event-based vision project and see it through to completion.

Thank you for your understanding and guidance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

### Shorter, More Natural Version

Subject: Quick question about my thesis topic

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I'm writing to ask about potentially shifting the focus of my bachelor thesis.

My current project is on event-based action recognition. While working on it, I started exploring a related topic—using 3D Gaussian Splatting for minimal-detail robot navigation—and I've found myself much more passionate and motivated by this new direction.

I've already put together a full proposal and completed initial experiments for this new idea, and I'm prepared for the presentation tomorrow on either topic.

I would love to pursue the 3DGS project, but I wanted to get your opinion first. If you think the topic isn't a good fit, I am more than happy to continue with the original plan.

Thanks for your time.

Best,

### Update on 3D Environment Project

Subject: Update on 3D Environment Exploration

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

Following up on my interest in lightweight 3D reconstruction, I wanted to share some progress on a related exploration. I've been working on a pipeline that takes a monocular video feed and generates a primitive-based 3D reconstruction of the scene.

This prototype uses MiDaS for depth estimation, YOLOv8 for object detection, and Open3D to convert these into a 3D point cloud with bounding boxes, which is then rendered. I've successfully built and debugged a functional pipeline that processes individual frames, demonstrating the feasibility of creating simplified 3D representations for applications like robotic navigation.

This work further reinforces my motivation to pursue research in efficient 3D scene understanding, particularly for closing the "Sim-to-Real" gap in robotics.

Best,

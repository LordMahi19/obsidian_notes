 I have changed my thesis plan and research. For making the project less complicated my professor has proposed  to change the plan. The model that I trained on dvs128 dataset remains. I will collect its stats like accuracy and other metrics. Then I will record my own video of the same pose from different angle, distance and with other changes. Then I will convert the data to event data using v2e. Then I will add these data to the test set of my previous code. then I will rerun the model training and evaluate the change. My professor expects the accuracy to drop. Then I will add similar synthetic to training set. Then I will rerun the training once again. Then I will evaluate the accuracy again. If more data injection improved the model accuracy it would mean that, since the dvs gesture dataset contains data that were recorded in lab environment, it does not perform well when faced data from real world. The research tries to find out if injecting more data from the real world in the training set improves the model accuracy.

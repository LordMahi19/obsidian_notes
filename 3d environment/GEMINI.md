# Gemini Project Context: Bachelor Thesis on NeRFs

## Directory Overview

This directory serves as the planning and documentation hub for a bachelor thesis focused on **"Investigating the Suitability of Neural Radiance Fields for Robotic Perception."** It contains the evolution of the research idea, the formal proposal, and a log of the technical setup for the experimental part of the thesis. The primary goal is to produce a written thesis, and the work recorded here supports that goal.

## Key Files

*   `thesis.md`: This is the formal thesis proposal. It includes a detailed abstract, a list of research questions, and a full chapter-by-chapter plan for the thesis, from literature review to final conclusion.
*   `research_ideas.md`: Contains the initial brainstorming for the thesis. It explores various avenues within 3D computer vision, leading to the selection of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) as the core topic.
*   `session_summary.md`: A log file documenting the setup process for the `instant-ngp` software, which is the core of the experimental work. It details progress, technical roadblocks (like the CMake version issue), and the immediate next steps required to get the software running.

## Usage

This directory is for managing the research and documentation aspects of the thesis.

*   Refer to `thesis.md` for the formal structure and research questions.
*   Consult `session_summary.md` to get up to speed on the current status of the software setup and to see what to work on next.

**Note:** The actual code for the project (`instant-ngp`) is located outside this workspace, at `C:\Users\mahia\OneDrive - LUT University\Desktop\thesis\instant-ngp`.

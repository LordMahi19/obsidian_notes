*Title: Completion Plan*  
*Bullets:*  
- Phase 2: Collect/convert custom data (1-2 weeks)  
- Phase 3: Test degradation (1 week)  
- Phase 4: Retrain model (1-2 weeks)  
- Phase 5: Evaluate improvement (1 week)  
- Phase 6: Analyze/write-up (2-3 weeks)  
- Milestones: Draft by [date], Final submission by [thesis deadline]  
*Visual: Gantt chart or timeline*

For the remaining work, I'll follow the six-phase plan. Phase 2: Finish recording 50+ videos per gesture with variations and convert them via v2e—aiming for completion in 1-2 weeks. Phase 3: Create an augmented test set and quantify performance drop with the baseline model (1 week).

Phase 4: Augment the training set and retrain (1-2 weeks, monitoring for overfitting). Phase 5: Evaluate the retrained model on the augmented test (1 week). Finally, Phase 6: Analyze metrics, discuss hypothesis, and write the thesis (2-3 weeks).

I'll incorporate potential extensions like basic augmentations or SNN trials if time allows. Milestones include a full draft by mid-December and final submission by the thesis deadline. This timeline accounts for holidays and buffers for debugging.

*(Timing: 2 minutes. End positively. Transition to conclusion.)*

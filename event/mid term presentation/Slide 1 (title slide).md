Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Thank you for joining my midterm presentation on my bachelor thesis titled "Improving Robustness of Event-Based Models." My name is [Your Name], and today I'll cover the background, research problem and objectives, scope and limitations, methods and data sources, my progress so far, and my plan for completing the thesis. This should take about 20 minutes, and I'll be happy to take questions at the end.

*(Timing: 30 seconds. Transition to next slide.)*

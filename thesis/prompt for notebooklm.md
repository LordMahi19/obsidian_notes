### General Purpose & High-Level Understanding

Start with these prompts to get a broad overview and identify key themes across your sources.

*   "Based on all my sources, generate a summary of the key advantages of event-based cameras over traditional RGB cameras for action recognition."
*   "Identify the main challenges in using event-based data for action recognition as discussed in my sources."
*   "Provide a list of key terms and their definitions related to neuromorphic vision, event-based cameras, and spiking neural networks from the uploaded papers."

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Use these prompts to get supporting information for your introduction.

*   **For Section 1.1 (Background and Motivation):** "Using the 'Event-based Vision: A Survey' paper and my thesis abstract, draft a section on the background and motivation for my thesis. Explain the limitations of traditional RGB cameras and why event-based cameras are a promising alternative for robotics."

### Chapter 2: Background and Literature Review

This is where NotebookLM can do a lot of the heavy lifting.

*   **For Section 2.1 & 2.2 (Conventional vs. Event-Based Cameras):** "Compare and contrast the working principles, data output, and key characteristics (temporal resolution, dynamic range, power consumption) of conventional frame-based cameras and event-based cameras. Use the 'Event-based Vision: A Survey' paper as the primary source."
*   **For Section 2.3 (Action Recognition Techniques):** "Based on all my sources, provide an overview of how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are used for action recognition. Explain how each architecture is adapted for both event-based and frame-based data."
*   **For Section 2.4 (Review of Key Papers):** "Generate a literature review of the key papers I've uploaded. For each paper ('Event-based Vision: A Survey', 'EV-ACT', and 'SpikMamba'), provide a summary of its main contributions, methodology, and relevance to my thesis topic of comparing event-based and RGB cameras for action recognition."

### Chapter 3: Methodology

These prompts will help you outline your experimental plan.

*   **For Section 3.1 (Dataset Selection):** "Based on the 'EV-ACT' paper, describe the EV-ACT dataset. Explain why it is a suitable benchmark for my thesis experiments. Also, search the other papers for any other relevant datasets mentioned."
*   **For Section 3.3 (Models for Comparison):** "From the 'SpikMamba' and 'EV-ACT' papers, describe the model architectures used for event-based action recognition. Summarize the key components of the SpikMamba architecture and the slow-fast network from EV-ACT."
*   **For Section 3.4 (Evaluation Metrics):** "Based on all my sources, what are the standard evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of action recognition models? List and briefly explain metrics for accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness."

### For the SpikingJelly Tutorial

*   "From the SpikingJelly tutorial, explain the basic concepts of Spiking Neural Networks. How does SpikingJelly facilitate the implementation of SNNs? Provide a brief summary of the key steps to build and train an SNN using this library."

### Pro-Tip for using NotebookLM:

After generating a response, use the **"Turn response into..."** feature in NotebookLM to refine the output. For example, you can ask it to turn a response into a "more formal paragraph," "a bulleted list," or "a section for a research paper." This will help you get closer to a final draft.
